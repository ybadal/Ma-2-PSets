\section*{Problem 1}
An obvious candidate for a trial function that might satisfy our differential equation is $\lambda = -2; u(t) = e^{\lambda t}$. We try this with our equation:
\begin{align*}
\lambda^2 e^{\lambda t} + 4 \lambda e^{\lambda t} + 4e^{\lambda t} &= 0 \\
\lambda^2 e^{\lambda t} + 4 \lambda + 4 = 0 \\
(\lambda +2)^2 = 0
\end{align*}
We can see that $u(t)=e^{-2t}$ works as a solution. Now, we try a solution of the form $u(t) = te^{\lambda t}$, since both the first and second derivatives will give us a linear combination of $e^{\lambda t}$ and $te^{\lambda t}$.
\begin{align*}
\lambda^2 t e^{\lambda t} + 2 \lambda t e^{\lambda t} + 4 \lambda t e^{\lambda t} + 4e^{\lambda t} + 4te^{\lambda t} &= 0 \\
(\lambda^2 + 4\lambda +4)te^{\lambda t} + (2\lambda +4)e^{\lambda t} &= 0
\end{align*}
We can again see that $\lambda = -2; u(t) = te^{-2t}$ works.

Clearly, we now have two linearly independent solutions to our differential equations. We therefore have a general solution:
\[
u(t) = C_1 e^{-2t} + C_2 te^{-2t}
\] and 
\[
\dv{u}{t} = -2C_1e^{-2t} - 2C_2te^{-2t} + C_2 e^{-2t}
\]
in which we can plug in our initial conditions. This gives:
\begin{align*}
C_1 &= 5 \\
-2C_1 + C_2 &= 7 \\
C_2 &= 17
\end{align*}
Which gives us the solution:
\[
u(t) = 5e^{-2t} + 17te^{-2t}
\]

\section*{Problem 2}
First, we set up the matrix $A$ for the homogeneous differential equation as in Lecture 6.
\[
A = \mqty(0 & 1 \\ -2 & -3)
\]
We can now find the eigenvalues of this matrix:
\begin{align*}
det(A-\lambda I) &= 0 \\
\mdet{-\lambda & 1 \\ -2 & -3-\lambda} &= 0 \\
\lambda(\lambda + 3) + 2 &= 0 \\
(\lambda + 2)(\lambda + 1) &= 0
\end{align*}
We thus find $\lambda_1 = -1; \lambda_2 = -2$. We will proceed by finding a special solution for the equation for one forcing term at a time, then taking a linear combination of our solutions, as per Lecture 8.

We can factor our differential operator $L=D^2 + 3D + 2$ as $L = (D-\lambda_1)(D-\lambda_2) = (D+1)(D+2)$. 

Therefore, for an equation of the form $Lu=e^{\rho t}$, we can use the guess $u(t) = Ce^{\rho t}$ and the result $Lu = C(\rho - \lambda_1)(\rho - \lambda_2)e^{\rho t}$ to find a specific solution to $Lu = e^{3t}$. From above, we have $C = \frac{1}{(\rho - \lambda_1)(\rho - \lambda_2)} = \frac{1}{20}; u(t) = \frac{1}{20} e^{3t}$.

For an equation of the form $Lu = te^{\rho t}$, we can use the guess $u(t) = C_1 te^{\rho t} + C_2 e^{\rho t}$ and the result $Lu = C_1(\rho - \lambda_1)(\rho - \lambda_2)te^{\rho t} + (C_1[(\rho - \lambda_1) + (\rho - \lambda_2)] + C_2(\rho - \lambda_1)(\rho - \lambda_2))e^{\rho t}$ to find a specific solution to $Lu = te^{4t}$. From above, we have $C_1 = \frac{1}{(\rho - \lambda_1)(\rho - \lambda_2)} = \frac{1}{30}$ and $C_2 = -C_1 (\frac{1}{\rho - \lambda_1} + \frac{1}{\rho - \lambda_2}) = \frac{-11}{900}; u(t) = -\frac{11}{900} te^{4t}$.

We now need to take care of the equation of the form $Lu = t^2 e^{-2t}$. We observe that the value of the exponent is $\lambda_2 = -2$. This means that it's useless to have any term of the form $t^2 e^{\lambda_2 t}$ in our guess function, because the $(D - \lambda_2)$ operator kills it. We figure a more sophisticated guess is appropriate, and choose $u(t) = C_1 t^3 e^{\lambda_2 t} + C_2 t^2 e^{\lambda_2 t} + C_3 t e^{\lambda_2 t}$ in the hope that each term cleans up the previous one's mess leaving behind only the $t^2 e^{\lambda_2 t}$ term.

We apply $(D - \lambda_2)$ and obtain
\[
(D - \lambda_2)u = C_1 (3t^2 e^{\lambda_2 t}) + C_2(2t e^{\lambda_2 t}) + C_3 (e^{\lambda_2 t})
\]
We apply $(D - \lambda_1)$ and obtain
\begin{align*}
(D - \lambda_1)(D - \lambda_2)u =& 3C_1(\lambda_2 t^2 e^{\lambda_2 t} + 2te^{\lambda_2 t} - \lambda_1 t^2 e^{\lambda_2 t}) + \\
& 2C_2(\lambda_2 t e^{\lambda_2 t} + e^{\lambda_2 t} - \lambda_1 te^{\lambda_2 t}) + C_3(\lambda_2 e^{\lambda_2 t} - \lambda_1 e^{\lambda_2 t}) \\
=& 3C_1 (\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)t^2 e^{\lambda_2 t} + \\
& (6C_1 + 2C_2 \big[\lambda_2 - \lambda_1\big])t e^{\lambda_2 t} + (2C_2 + C_3 \big[\lambda_2 - \lambda_2 \big])e^{\lambda_2 t}
\end{align*}
In order to make the appropriate terms appear and disappear, we set:
\begin{align*}
C_1 &= \frac{1}{3(\lambda_2 - \lambda_1)}  = -\frac{1}{3} \\
C_2 &= \frac{-3C_1}{\lambda_2 - \lambda_1} = -1\\
C_3 &= \frac{-2C_2}{\lambda_2 - \lambda_2} = -2
\end{align*}
and obtain the solution
\[
u(t) = -\frac{1}{3} t^3 e^{-2t} - t^2 e^{-2t} - 2t e^{-2t}.
\]
By linearity, we then have a special solution for our original differential equation:
\[
u(t) = \frac{1}{20} e^{3t} - \frac{11}{900} te^{4t} -\frac{1}{3} t^3 e^{-2t} - t^2 e^{-2t} - 2t e^{-2t}
\]
